# My Web Project

This project is a simple website consisting of three main pages: Home, Locations, and Contact. It is designed to demonstrate basic HTML, CSS, and responsive web design techniques. The project includes a navigation bar and a form for user interaction.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files and directories:

- **index.html**: The homepage of the website, featuring three text boxes with sample content.
- **pages/locations.html**: A page displaying a series of images related to various locations.
- **contact.html**: A contact form for users to submit their name and message.
- **css/style.css**: The stylesheet used to style the pages consistently across the site.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website adjusts its layout based on the screen size, providing a good experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Navigation Bar**: A simple navigation bar allows users to switch between the Home, Locations, and Contact pages.
- **Form Handling**: A basic form on the Contact page allows users to input their name and message.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the pages and ensuring responsive design.

## Development Notes

- **Git Usage**: I started using Git after the completion of the project. As a result, there are not many logs or commits available in the repository. This project serves as a learning experience in both web development and version control with Git.

## Getting Started

To view the project locally, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Ensure that the directory structure remains intact so that all links and styles work correctly.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sentino2/25feb-hand-in.git
cd your-repo-name
